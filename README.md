# Neural-Networks-for-Cellular-Automata-Classification
Code and neural nets for my abstract on this topic for the ALife 2019 conference.

The Mathematica notebook contains the complete code and results reported in the abstract -- please excuse the messiness!
The .wlnet files contain trained neural network weights that can be directly imported into Mathematica.  The file _trained2c2.wlnet_ is Network II, and _netECA3-21may.wlnet_ is Network III.

The images and PDFs included here are feature inversion images of the 16 convolutional channels in each convolutional layer.  Each image shows the features that most excite those particular nodes in the network, and therefore give us some idea of what image features the network finds most important.  There wasn't space to report these in the abstract but with luck I may publish these later.
